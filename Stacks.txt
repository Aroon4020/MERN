proof of transfer:

two parties involved in this concensus

1: STX miners: Send BTC to compete, to earn stacks tokens

the more bitcoin u commit higher the chances of initiating the block
leader is selected by varifiable random function

2: Stackers: add value to the network and lock up their tokens and earn BTC send by miners

NFT=> unique tokens that belongs to owner and ownership can be transffered value can be increased


Minting=> making money out of tokes eg: making coins out of metals

fungable tokens=> same value over exchange no uniqueness
