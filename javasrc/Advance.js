//Event propogation tells that in which order the elements recieve the event

// higher order function: function whoch take an other function as arguments is called HOF
// callback function: function which passed as argument is called callback function
// calculator(3,5,sum) // here calculator is HOF and sum is a callback function: 


/////////////// Asynchronous Javascript

//1: Hoisting in js: it's mechanism where Var and function declarion are moved to the top of there scope before code execution


//2: scope chain and lexical scooping in javascript: inner function can access the outer function but viceversa is not true

//3: closure in js:

// synchronous JS: blocking: waiting 1 work at a time
// Asynchronous JS: Nonblocking: multiple operation running simultaniously 

// Event Loop : Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack/ execution stack
