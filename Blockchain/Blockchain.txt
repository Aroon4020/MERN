cryptography: plain text to cipher text to plain text. encryption to decryption and vice versa. 
this is used to acheive confidentiality(no one can read your data)
confidentiality achieved by encryption

cryptography achived by symertric (1)key and asymetric (2)key


Digital Signature: proof in a hand of reciver that this belongs to a particular

Any change in blockchian go through concensus protocol 
BLockchain: record of data stored on network of computer
*****3 pillars of blockchain*****
1: decentralization: data store on multiple comp and no single entity manages/controll the data store

2: Transparency: public ledger everyone can see the data

3: Immutability/ unchangable: this acheived through cryptography & blockchain Hashing


***** USES of BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY *****
bitcoin and etherium are use cases of blockchian technology
bitcoin is digital currency and/or store of value

Ether: digital currency, ether was created as a form payment to fuel etherum network
amount of ether required for network fees(to fuel etherium network) is determined by GAS
3 layers of etherium: a) hardware(nodes of etherum blc)
		      b) software layer: for smartcontract using solidity
		      c) application layer: for building dapps
