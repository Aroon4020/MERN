hyperledger is project under linux foundation for creating permissioned/ private blockchain

Membership service provider: validate and authenticate the user to register/ be part of system and gives the level of rights to a particular node
MSP request certification authority

-No cryptocurrency

- each and every entity is modulare(plug and play)

- consensus is driven by node(endoreser) who validate transaction

- Channels : a way communicating with two entities whitout without disclosing the transaction with others in network 
in a single blc network u can multiple n/w toghter
- chaincode: smart contract in hyperledger

endorser run chaincode to see that the transaction is valid or not

MSP
CA
Endorser
Orderers: special Nodes, 1:create the block from transactions 2:Distribute the block to all nodes including endorser and commiters
Commiters: they will get the block from ordering service they will verify that the transaction that are part of block are endorse by endorser are not
once they verify then they update thier ledger and trasaction added to blc


Unique advantages of hyperledger Fabric:
Permissioned membership
Rich query overimmutable distributable ledger
Modular architechure supporting plug-in components

Problems with Existing Blockchain:
Limited throughput:
slow transaction conformation
NO privacy
Public: any one can join

Hyperledger Architechure:

1)Membership Service: provide registration service 

2) Blockchain services: concensus, distributed ledger, ledger storage

3) Chain code: peice of code that lets you interact with network's shared ledger


Hyperledger Business Blockchain frameworks reach concesus by performming two separate activities:

1) ordering: collecting the transaction, creating the block and updating merkle tree and hashing and transmitting the block to the commiter node
2) Validating: (done by commiter node)

by logically separating these activity means hyperledger framework can work with any hyperledger consensus module

What is Consortium Blockchain? 
Federated blockchain or consortium blockchain is a blockchain technology where instead of only a single organization, multiple organizations govern the platform. 
It's not a public platform rather a permissioned platform.
