oop : a programming paradigm set of rules, standard in programing that we use to solve particular problem
car is a object: and has attribute/properties: make, model,color. and Behaviors/methods: start, stop move etc
reallife example mapping to programming


primitives datatypes: store single values:(byte, int, float etc)

structure: similar to classes but you can't define functions in structure

"A class is user defined datatype" to store data of differnt types and functions

class: template for object
object are type of class

4 main principal

1:encapsulation: we group related variables and functions into single entity class and provide getter setter functions to interact with class variables
not allow external classes to directly edit an obj attributes
biding data and operations in an entity




2: abstraction:  hiding properties and method from outside 
hiding complexity of program only showing relavant interfaces

3: inheritance: nheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically.
 In such way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other class.

4: polymorphism: 1: com_time poly 1a: function overloading 1b:opert overloadiing  
2: run_tim polymorphism 2a: virtual function


function overloading: same name differnt types and numbers of parameter

function overriding: redefining method of super class into subclass //run time polymorhism
